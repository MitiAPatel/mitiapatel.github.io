								<p>Hello! I’m Miti Patel, a bioengineer with a passion for biomechanics and space research.</p>
								<p>I will be graduating from Northeastern University in May 2024 with a B.S. in Bioengineering, with Minors in Data Science and Physics. During my time here, I have completed 2 research co-ops exploring biomaterials and cellular engineering/biomechanics, and participated in a variety of extracurricular activities to really discover where my interests lay. Check out my <a href="#projects">projects</a> and <a href="#research">research</a>.</p>
								<p>In 2022, I completed my first co-op at Bio-Techne focused on developing novel polymeric hydrogels for immune cell activation, cell separation, and other CGT applications. I designed and performed numerous experiments testing the hydrogel platform. To collect and analyze data, I executed a variety of assays, ran flow cytometry panels, and created multiple MATLAB image/data analysis scripts to simplify future workflows. Here, I discovered my interest in simulations and data analysis automation.</p>
								<p>Currently, I am a Bioengineer at DropGenie after being offered an extension on my second co-op.  I am working to optimize DropGenie’s microfluidic platform for electroporation in the field of cell engineering. I developed and executed a variety of protocols to perform Knock-Outs and Knock-Ins in T-Cells, using a multitude of different technologies to engineer cells at the TRAC locus. Aside from the bioengineering work, I also spent some time doing pure engineering, writing SOPs for chip fabrication and assembly, while also programming a liquid handler to automate the entire experimental workflow. I further developed my MATLAB skills and learned R to analyze data and find new correlations within our data sets. I am continuing this work right now, facilitating various partnerships with other companies and expanding DropGenie’s customer base.</p>
								<p>Throughout my time at Northeastern, I have also been an active member in a multitude of clubs and organizations: Society of Women Engineers, Biomedical Engineering Society, Studio Art Club, Mars Rover, and Aerospace NU.</p>
								<p>Starting in 2020, I began my career with Aerospace NU and since that time have taken on a much bigger role in the club. Although I started as a Propulsion team project member, I soon started my own project, now named Project Stelline, that boasts the title of having executed the first successful hotfire in the club. I also became a mentor to incoming club members, and currently teach them propulsion engineering and other aspects of the engineering process.</p>
								<p>In Mars Rover, I got the chance to further build upon my MATLAB interests, developing a multitude of scripts to aid in image analysis from images obtained on the Mars Rover from our life detections tests. I truly enjoy the combination of bioengineering and space in this club and am excited for more new projects this year.</p>
								<p>Overall, after countless hours spent over rocket engine designs, fluid mechanics homework, and failed T-cell experiments, I will have developed a wide skill set that helped me find my interest in figuring out how biology functions on a physical level, and how we can manipulate biology to expand research endeavors. Specifically, I am especially interested in microfluidics, biofluids, and biomaterials and how they are affected by space environments, and I hope to one day work on research related to these topics.</p>

							<article id="spaghettiengine">
								<h2 class="major">Spaghetti Engine</h2>
								<p>In AerospaceNU, the first thing I designed freshman year was a liquid rocket engine. First, I had to find the appropriate dimensions using NASA's Chemical Equilibrium Analysis (CEA) calculator. This was able to provide me with nozzle dimensions after inputting values such as Oxidizer/Fuel (O/F) ratio and intended thrust of the engine.</p>
								<p>Following this, I was able to perform Rao approximation to design the nozzle and chamber of the engine. You can see this design below, as well as the final flow simulation showing ideal flow.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/xMF2f3R/Screen-Shot-2023-10-25-at-3-24-57-PM.png" alt="" /></span>
								<span class="image main"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/6mcDn14/Screen-Shot-2023-10-25-at-3-25-52-PM.png" alt="" /></span>
								<span class="image main"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/2YQc7Tb/IMG-5505.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>However, this design was too difficult to manufacture and would make it difficult to change out the nozzle to test different nozzle types. For this reason, the design was further optimized to below.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/4YgXJ12/Screen-Shot-2023-10-25-at-3-33-41-PM.png" alt="" /></span>

								<p>This design was the final design that was manufactured using machining on a CNC mill and lathe.</p>

							<article id="feedsystem">
								<h2 class="major">Feed System</h2>
								<p>To test out the engine, we had to build a feed system to input the appropriate amount of oxidizer and fuel at the correct temperatures, pressures, flow rates, and a variety of other variables. Using a multitude of valves, pressure transducers, pipes, and electronics, we were able to develop a working feed system. We also included load cells to measure the final thrust in three directions. Below is what the feed system looked like in development.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/0j2S2LD/Screen-Shot-2023-10-25-at-3-47-42-PM.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>After spending many months (and a lot of money), we were able to create a working test stand. I even painted on our logos because of my painting skills!</p>

								<p>We also had to design some custom parts for this, such as this venturi valve to calculate change in pressure.</p>

							<article id="hotfire">
								<h2 class="major">Hot Fire!</h2>
								<p>Hot fire was the culmination of all mine and my team's efforts. We were able to successfully ignite the engine, making it the first successful hot fire in the history of the club. We were super excited to even see the beginnings of choked flow, which is exactly what we wanted to accomplish. You can see a gif of the hot fire below!</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/kqNxmSt/Spaghetti-Hot-Fire-April-2023-2.gif" alt="" /></span>
								<p>And, here is a picture of me with some of my mentees at hot fire testing their new injector design!</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/SyyfFdZ/44-F6274-C-D5-F8-4238-8-DAD-5-D58-DC3-F10-B0.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Overall, this was a ton of fun, and I learned so much from this multi-year long project. We are planning on performing another hot fire with the new designs that the mentees create this year!</p>

							<article id="ablativenozzle">
								<h2 class="major">Ablative Nozzle</h2>
								<p>My first year as a mentor for Intro to Propulsion, I taught my mentees how to design and develop an ablative nozzle. An ablative is a type of material that chars when exposed to open flame or extreme temperatures aiding in creating a more heat resistent engine. They were able to use phenolic resin to develop an ablative nozzle for firing.</p>
								<p>Below is an image of the ablative nozzle my mentees created using nozzle design, heat transfer, material science, and chemistry concepts. It is hard to see the internal geometry, but know that it was a challenge to create...</p>

							<article id="hybridengine">
								<h2 class="major">Hybrid Engine</h2>
								<p>This year as a propulsion mentor, we are trying to create a whole new type of engine for the club, a hybrid engine. While the club has expertise in developing Liquid Rocket Engines and Solid Rocket Engines, hybrid engines are something we haven't attempted before. I am teaching my mentees how to manufacture a hybrid engine fuel grain that takes into account fuel burn rates and other heat transfer concepts. While the final product is still in progress, I linked a presentation I created showcasing how to perform the calculations to develop a hybrid rocket engine.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Live/Dead Cells</h2>
								<p>I wrote an image analysis script on MATLAB that took in fluorescence microscope images and outputted the number of live and dead cells per image. I attached the .m file of this code below that also includes statical analysis of the results. Overall, the goal was to determine how changes in the conditions of hydrogels affect the cells embedded in them.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Work at DropGenie</h2>
								<p>Below is a poster summarizing my research on using microfluidics to genetically engineer CAR-T cells. I presented this work at the 6th International Conference on CRISPR Technologies. It was fascinating to learn about the latest and greatest technologies regarding gene editing, and I was able to take note of techniques that would improve my own procedures. I also met many amazing people who were doing incredible work in the area!

								<p>I also had the amazing opportunity to give a podium talk about my research developing CAR-T cells using the DropGenie Platform at the 2024 Society of Laboratory Automation and Screening International Conference and Exhibition. I learned so much about advertising research and creating connections with companies and researchers, but also learned how to sell myself and my skills as a researchers. I once again got to meet so many incredible scientists and engineers, and explored the many new technologies that are being created to optimize lab research. I even confirmed that my pipetting skills are gold medal worthy! You can see the slides for my talk here:
